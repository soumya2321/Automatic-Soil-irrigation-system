Review on Automatic Soil Irrigation System
Aim

The main aim of the project Automatic Soil Irrigation System is to design a low-cost, efficient, and automated solution for watering plants. The system eliminates the need for manual irrigation and helps conserve water by supplying only the required amount based on soil moisture content.

Working Principle

The project is based on the use of a soil moisture sensor interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller. The sensor measures the moisture content of the soil and sends analog values to the controller. These values are processed, and the system decides whether irrigation is required.
When the soil moisture level is below the set threshold, the microcontroller activates a water pump connected to a relay.
When the soil moisture level is sufficient, the pump is automatically switched off.
Thus, the system maintains an optimum moisture level in the soil.


Components Used

Arduino microcontroller
Soil moisture sensor
Relay module and water pump
Power supply and connecting wires

Advantages

Water Conservation – Prevents over-irrigation and reduces water wastage.

Low Cost and Simple Design – Affordable and easy to implement for farmers.
Improved Crop Growth – Maintains optimum soil moisture, leading to better plant health.
Scalability – Can be extended to larger agricultural fields with multiple sensors.

Applications

Smart agriculture and farming
Household gardening and nurseries
Greenhouses and plantations
Conclusion

The Automatic Soil Irrigation System is an innovative project that combines embedded systems and sensor technology to solve a real-world agricultural challenge. It promotes sustainable farming by conserving water and ensuring healthy crop growth with minimal human effort. Presenting this project at Scinova provided us with valuable exposure and practical knowledge, and it motivated us to further explore the role of technology in smart farming and environmental sustainability.
